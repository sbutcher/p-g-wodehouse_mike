				<p epub:type="title">Jellicoe Goes on the Sick-List</p>
			</hgroup>
			<p>Mike woke next morning with a confused memory of having listened to a great deal of incoherent conversation from Jellicoe, and a painfully vivid recollection of handing over the bulk of his worldly wealth to him. The thought depressed him, though it seemed to please Jellicoe, for the latter carolled in a gay undertone as he dressed, till Psmith, who had a sensitive ear, asked as a favour that these farmyard imitations might cease until he was out of the room.</p>
			<p>There were other things to make Mike low-spirited that morning. To begin with, he was in detention, which in itself is enough to spoil a day. It was a particularly fine day, which made the matter worse. In addition to this, he had never felt stiffer in his life. It seemed to him that the creaking of his joints as he walked must be audible to everyone within a radius of several yards. Finally, there was the interview with <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Downing to come. That would probably be unpleasant. As Psmith had said, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Downing was the sort of master who would be likely to make trouble. The great match had not been an ordinary match. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Downing was a curious man in many ways, but he did not make a fuss on ordinary occasions when his bowling proved expensive. Yesterday’s performance, however, stood in a class by itself. It stood forth without disguise as a deliberate rag. One side does not keep another in the field the whole day in a one-day match except as a grisly kind of practical joke. And <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Downing and his house realised this. The house’s way of signifying its comprehension of the fact was to be cold and distant as far as the seniors were concerned, and abusive and pugnacious as regards the juniors. Young blood had been shed overnight, and more flowed during the eleven o’clock interval that morning to avenge the insult.</p>
			<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Downing’s methods of retaliation would have to be, of necessity, more elusive; but Mike did not doubt that in some way or other his form-master would endeavour to get a bit of his own back.</p>
			<p>As events turned out, he was perfectly right. When a master has got his knife into a boy, especially a master who allows himself to be influenced by his likes and dislikes, he is inclined to single him out in times of stress, and savage him as if he were the official representative of the evildoers. Just as, at sea, the skipper, when he has trouble with the crew, works it off on the boy.</p>
			<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Downing was in a sarcastic mood when he met Mike. That is to say, he began in a sarcastic strain. But this sort of thing is difficult to keep up. By the time he had reached his peroration, the rapier had given place to the bludgeon. For sarcasm to be effective, the user of it must be met halfway. His hearer must appear to be conscious of the sarcasm and moved by it. Mike, when masters waxed sarcastic towards him, always assumed an air of stolid stupidity, which was as a suit of mail against satire.</p>
			<p>So <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Downing came down from the heights with a run, and began to express himself with a simple strength which it did his form good to listen to. Veterans who had been in the form for terms said afterwards that there had been nothing to touch it, in their experience of the orator, since the glorious day when Dunster, that prince of raggers, who had left at Christmas to go to a crammer’s, had introduced three lively grass-snakes into the room during a Latin lesson.</p>
			<p>“You are surrounded,” concluded <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Downing, snapping his pencil in two in his emotion, “by an impenetrable mass of conceit and vanity and selfishness. It does not occur to you to admit your capabilities as a cricketer in an open, straightforward way and place them at the disposal of the school. No, that would not be dramatic enough for you. It would be too commonplace altogether. Far too commonplace!” <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Downing laughed bitterly. “No, you must conceal your capabilities. You must act a lie. You must⁠—who is that shuffling his feet? I will not have it, I <em>will</em> have silence⁠—you must hang back in order to make a more effective entrance, like some wretched actor who⁠—I will <em>not</em> have this shuffling. I have spoken of this before. Macpherson, are you shuffling your feet?”</p>
			<p>“Sir, no, sir.”</p>
			<p>“Please, sir.”</p>
			<p>“Well, Parsons?”</p>
			<p>“I think it’s the noise of the draught under the door, sir.”</p>
			<p>Instant departure of Parsons for the outer regions. And, in the excitement of this side-issue, the speaker lost his inspiration, and abruptly concluded his remarks by putting Mike on to translate in Cicero. Which Mike, who happened to have prepared the first half-page, did with much success.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>The Old Boys’ match was timed to begin shortly after eleven o’clock. During the interval most of the school walked across the field to look at the pitch. One or two of the Old Boys had already changed and were practising in front of the pavilion.</p>
			<p>It was through one of these batsmen that an accident occurred which had a good deal of influence on Mike’s affairs.</p>
			<p>Mike had strolled out by himself. Halfway across the field Jellicoe joined him. Jellicoe was cheerful, and rather embarrassingly grateful. He was just in the middle of his harangue when the accident happened.</p>
			<p>To their left, as they crossed the field, a long youth, with the faint beginnings of a moustache and a blazer that lit up the surrounding landscape like a glowing beacon, was lashing out recklessly at a friend’s bowling. Already he had gone within an ace of slaying a small boy. As Mike and Jellicoe proceeded on their way, there was a shout of “Heads!”</p>
			<p>The almost universal habit of batsmen of shouting “Heads!” at whatever height from the ground the ball may be, is not a little confusing. The average person, on hearing the shout, puts his hands over his skull, crouches down and trusts to luck. This is an excellent plan if the ball is falling, but is not much protection against a skimming drive along the ground.</p>
			<p>When “Heads!” was called on the present occasion, Mike and Jellicoe instantly assumed the crouching attitude.</p>
			<p>Jellicoe was the first to abandon it. He uttered a yell and sprang into the air. After which he sat down and began to nurse his ankle.</p>
			<p>The bright-blazered youth walked up.</p>
			<p>“Awfully sorry, you know, man. Hurt?”</p>
			<p>Jellicoe was pressing the injured spot tenderly with his fingertips, uttering sharp howls whenever, zeal outrunning discretion, he prodded himself too energetically.</p>
			<p>“Silly ass, Dunster,” he groaned, “slamming about like that.”</p>
			<p>“Awfully sorry. But I did yell.”</p>
			<p>“It’s swelling up rather,” said Mike. “You’d better get over to the house and have it looked at. Can you walk?”</p>
			<p>Jellicoe tried, but sat down again with a loud “Ow!” At that moment the bell rang.</p>
			<p>“I shall have to be going in,” said Mike, “or I’d have helped you over.”</p>
			<p>“I’ll give you a hand,” said Dunster.</p>
			<p>He helped the sufferer to his feet and they staggered off together, Jellicoe hopping, Dunster advancing with a sort of polka step. Mike watched them start and then turned to go in.</p>
